1.	Structure: Web APIs usually follow REST (Representational State Transfer) or SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) standards, with REST being the more common due to its simplicity and flexibility.
2.	Communication via HTTP: Web APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform various operations:
o	GET: Retrieve data
o	POST: Create new data
o	PUT: Update existing data
o	DELETE: Remove data
3.	Data Format: Data is often exchanged in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML formats, with JSON being the most popular due to its readability and lightweight structure.
4.	Usage: Web APIs are widely used in applications, enabling integration between services (e.g., integrating payment processing, weather information, social media feeds, etc.).
Web APIs are essential in modern web development, as they allow seamless communication between different software systems across the internet.
